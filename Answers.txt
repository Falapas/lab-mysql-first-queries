#7. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 5. Give some insights.**

# The top 10 apps with most ratings are social-media apps, audio apps, or game apps.



#8. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 6. Give some insights.**

# The 10 apps best rated by users are all game apps, except for one.



#9. Now compare the data from questions 5 and 6. What do you see?**

# The more number of ratings there is, the more difficult it gets to have an average rating of 5.0.



#10. How could you take the top 3 regarding the user ratings but also the number of votes?**

# Would have to group by trackname, order by user_rating, and rating_count_tot limit 3 in order to take the top 3.



#11. Does people care about the price?** Do some queries, comment why are you doing them and the results you retrieve. What is your conclusion?

# The ratings are higher for priced apps, so we can say that people care for priced apps. Free apps are rated more often, but with lower ratings, and we can deduce that they are also downloaded more often then the other apps.
